      <p>I grew up on the water in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio with my parents, twin and older sister (yes, my dad had 3 girls).</p>
      <p>I moved to Colorado after college and now live in Golden with my boyfriend and dog Bogey. <br> Rabbits are Bogey's kryptonite.</p>
      <p>I played all the sports as a kid and physical activity has continued to be a big part of my life.  I moonlight as a yoga teacher and spend as much time outside as I can – running, hiking, backpacking, fly fishing, paddle boarding, snowshoeing, biking, golfing… <br> I'm collecting hobbies. <br> I recently purchased a DSLR camera and enjoy taking pictures – good and horrible – on all our adventures, big and small.</p>

      <p>I’m very curious and thrive on human interaction.  I love being around people, meeting new people and hearing their stories.  Part of me tries to be offline as much as possible, and part is hooked on the ability to connect with almost anyone and discover just about anything.</p>
